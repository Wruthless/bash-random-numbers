# bash-random-numbers

I found myself having to do this task more often than one would think.

### Usage

Ensure the script is executable on your machine by running 

<pre>
$> chmod u+x bash_random.sh
</pre>

Then simply supply the number of random integers you wish to generate and a seperator.

<pre>
$> ./bash_random.sh 6 ,
28420,
13527,
32606,
20059,
20985,
15917,
</pre>


<pre>
$> ./bash_random.sh 8 +
12916+
6394+
4616+
9042+
19434+
12514+
11258+
28001+
</pre>
